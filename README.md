# Project 1 - Accessibility Standards

## Description

Updated code to meet accessibility standards so that those with disabilities can access the website using their desired assistive technology. Accessible websites are not only better positioned in search engines, they also can help to avoid litigation by providing access to those with disabilites.

Consolidated and organized CSS code so that it follows semantic structure of HTML, thus making it easier for another developer to view code.
